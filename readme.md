# Ktx Demos

![demos.gif](.github/demos.gif?raw=true)

This is a 'grab-bag of demos' - a bunch of small (single file) examples that highlight various libgdx/ktx features.

Notable examples - 

Libktx [app](https://github.com/libktx/ktx/tree/master/app), [scene2d](https://github.com/libktx/ktx/tree/master/scene2d), 
[graphics](https://github.com/libktx/ktx/tree/master/graphics), and [assets](https://github.com/libktx/ktx/tree/master/assets) usage throughout.

Shaders - Most of the examples here were ported from [mattdesl's lwjgl tutorials](https://github.com/mattdesl/lwjgl-basics).

The lightshafts example is a refactored version from an article by 
[Fabrizio Pietrucci](https://spaghettidevops.com/2017/03/22/rendering-a-godrays-effect-as-postprocess-in-libgdx-using-shaders). The water 
example is partly copied from [Rahul Srivastava's article](https://rotatingcanvas.com/fragment-shader-to-simulate-water-surface-in-libgdx).

Models - The animated model example uses a model from 
[games from scratch](https://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2014/01/19/3D-models-and-animation-from-Blender-to-LibGDX.aspx).

Bullet - Heavily refactored version of 
[ShootTest](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/tests/gdx-tests/src/com/badlogic/gdx/tests/bullet/ShootTest.java).

My goal is to gather lots of examples in one place - please add your own and submit a pull request!

The desktop launcher uses the old 'scene2d' style menu, and is meant to be for ad-hock debugging and testing (and should probably be avoided). 
The target platform for this project is intended to be Android.
