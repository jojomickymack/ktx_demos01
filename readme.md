# Ktx Demos

This is a 'grab-bag of demos' - basically just a place for me to dump a single screen demo or experiment as I tinker around with opengl shader 
techniques and various libgdx/ktx features.

Most of the examples here were ported directly from [mattdesl's lwjgl tutorials](https://github.com/mattdesl/lwjgl-basics).

The lightshafts example is a refactored version from an article by 
[Fabrizio Pietrucci](https://spaghettidevops.com/2017/03/22/rendering-a-godrays-effect-as-postprocess-in-libgdx-using-shaders). The water 
example is partly copied from [Rahul Srivastava's article](https://rotatingcanvas.com/fragment-shader-to-simulate-water-surface-in-libgdx).

The animated model example uses a model from 
[games from scratch](https://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2014/01/19/3D-models-and-animation-from-Blender-to-LibGDX.aspx).

My goal here was to gather a lot of advanced graphics tests into one place and have a 'work in progress' where anything can be tossed in.
